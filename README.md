# Sails hook RBAC

---

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-hook-rbac.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-hook-rbac)

---

`rbac2` hook for Sails v0.11 and up.

Allows you to set up RBAC2 rules in your API end-points

## Installation

Install from NPM.

```bash
$ npm install sails-hook-rbac --save
```

## Configuration options available

To configure this hook, you can create a file named `config/rbac.js`
with the following options:

```javascript
module.exports.rbac = {
  rbacRules: [
    { a: 'anonymous'}, 
    { a: 'normal', can: 'anonymous' },
    { a: 'admin', can: 'normal' }
    ],
  waitFor: [
    'custom',
    'session',
    'orm',
  ],
  helper: {
    path: 'services.RbacHelpers',
  },
  sessionObject: 'me',
  sessionObjectRolePath: 'role',
};
```

If you don't create the mentioned config file, it defaults to the above settings.

# Implementation details

This hook extends the normal Sails routes configuration.

It lets you add an `rbac` attribute to your routes that defines the Role-Based Access Control for that particular route.

The hook uses the session object in the request object (by default, `me`, configured in `sessionObject`) to get the 
user's role.

The user's *role* attribute can be configured in `sessionObjectRolePath`. It can be a simple attribute (defaults to 
`role`), or it can be a path to that attribute, in case the value is nested within the session object.

In the default configuration, valid *roles* are `normal` and `admin`.
There is a special role named `anonymous` that is assigned to all requests that don't have a user session.

All anonymous requests have a `req.me.role = 'anonymous'`

The `rbac` attribute in a Route definition is an object where it's attributes are *role definitions*.

Each of these 'roles' attributes are objects on their own, normally empty ones `{}`.

If a route needs to have a more advanced validation rule, a `when` attribute can be added.

This `when` attribute can be a function, or a string. If it is a function, it must match the following this signature:

```javascript
when: function ( params, callback ) {
  const result = validateFunctionGoesHere(params.me, params.body);
  if( result ) {
    return callback(null, true); 
  }
  return callback(null, false);
}
```
where
- `params` is an object with:
  - all attributes from the action: result from calling `req.allParams()`
  - `me` reference to `req.me`. This can be changed using the `sessionObject` configuration.
  - `body` reference to `req.body`
  - `req` reference to `req`
- `callback` needs to be called to return from the validation.
  The callback signature `callback(err, result)` matches regular Node.js callback signatures.
  The result is treated as a boolean. If `err` is not null, then `result` is considered `false`.

A more detailed explanation can be found in [rbac2 documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rbac2).

if the `when` attribute is a string, it will call the service configured in the `helper.path`.
For example:
```javascript
when: 'isOwner'
```
would call `sails.services.RbacHelpers.isOwner(params, next)`.

A `can` attribute can be added to a role definition, but a default one is generated by the hook.
It is inferred from the controller and action names, or the route path. In the following example, the
`can` attribute is set to `put-post-update`.

```javascript
{
  'put /post/:postId': {
    controller: 'post',
    action: 'update',
    rbac: {
      'normal': {
        when: function isAuthor(params, next) {
          return UserService.isAuthor(params, next);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, the `when` function calls the `UserService.isAuthor` function.

If no rbac is defined, a warning is shown in the console. That means, no RBAC will be checked for that route.
One good example of this behavior is the 'get /' route.

If the rule has a `route` attribute, this route will be used instead of the 'original' one. In some cases, two routes
conflict with each other, and the actual route needs to have a special regex.
One such case is if one route has a more strict rule. 
For example:
- the `/group/tree` and `/group/:groupId` routes. Normally, since `/group/tree` is listed first and before the more
  generic route, `/group/tree` should be hit if called. However, since `/group/:groupId` has a stricter rbac rule, 
  and matches, the order no longer matters, and the server tries to use the stricter route.
  The solution is to make the matching of a more restrictive pattern, so that `/group/tree` does not match 
  `/group/:groupId` using a regex that forces the groupId to be an id string.

- Support multiple roles
