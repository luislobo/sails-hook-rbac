`rbac2` hook for Sails v0.11 and up.

Allows you to set up RBAC2 rules in your API end-points

## Installation

Install from NPM.

```bash
$ npm install sails-hook-rbac --save
```

## Configuration options available

To configure this hook, you can create a file named `config/rbac.js`
with the following options:

```javascript
module.exports.rbac = {
  rbacRules: [
    {a: 'anonymous'}, {
      a: 'normal',
      can: 'anonymous',
    }, {
      a: 'admin',
      can: 'normal',
    }, {
      a: 'superAdmin',
      can: 'admin',
    }],
  waitFor: [
    'orm',
  ],
  helper: {
    path: 'services.RbacHelpers'
  },
  sessionObject: 'user',
  sessionObjectRolePath: 'role',
  rbac2: {
    checkFullPath: true,
    cacheTrees: true,
  },
};
```

If you don't create the mentioned config file, it defaults to the above settings.

# Implementation details

This hook extends the normal Sails routes configuration.

It lets you add an `rbac` attribute that defines the Role Based Access Control for that particular route.

The hook uses the session object in the request object (by default, `user`, configured in `sessionObject`) to get the 
user's role.

The user's *role* attribute can be configured in `sessionObjectRolePath`. It can be a simple attribute (defaults to 
`role`), or it can be a path to that attribute, in case the value is nested within the session object.

In the default configuration, valid *roles* are `normal`, `admin`, and `superAdmin`.
There is a special role named `anonymous` that is assigned to all requests that don't have a user session.

All anonymous requests have a `req.user.role = 'anonymous'`

The `rbac` attribute in a Route definition is an object where it's attributes are *role definitions*.

Each of these 'roles' attributes are objects on their own, normally empty ones `{}`.

If a route needs to have a more advanced validation rule, a `when` attribute can be added.

This `when` attribute can be a function that follows this signature:

```javascript
when: async function( params, callback ) {
  const result = await validateUserPermissions(params.user);
  if(  ) {
    callback(null, true); 
  }
}
```
where
- `params` is an object with:
  - all attributes from the action: result from calling `req.allParams()`
  - `user` reference to `req.user`. This can be changed using the `sessionObject` configuration.
  - `body` reference to `req.body`
  - `req` reference to `req`
- `callback` needs to be called to return from the validation.
  The callback signature `callback(err, result)` matches regular Node.js callback signatures.
  The result is treated as a boolean. If `err` is not null, then `result` is considered `false`.



A more detailed explanation can be found in [rbac2 documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rbac2).

A `can` attribute can be added to a role definition, but a default one is generated by the hook.
It is inferred from the controller and action names. In the following example, the
`can` attribute is set to `equipment.eventDisable`.

```javascript
{
  'put /equipment/eventDisable/:equipmentIds': {
    controller: 'equipment',
    action: 'eventDisable',
    rbac: {
      'normal': {
        when: function (params, next) {
          return sails.hooks.rbac.canDisableEvents(params, next);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, the `when` function calls the `sails.hooks.rbac.canDisableEvents` function.

If no rbac is defined, a warning is shown in the console. That means, no RBAC will be checked for that route.
One good example of this behavior is the 'get /' route.

If the rule has a `route` attribute, this route will be used instead of the 'original' one. In some cases, two routes
conflict with each other, and the actual route needs to have a special regex.
One such case is if one route has a more strict rule. For example: the /group/tree and /group/:groupId routes. Normally, since /group/tree is listed first and before the more generic route, /group/tree should be hit if called. However, since /group/:groupId has a stricter rbac rule, and matches, the order no longer matters and the server tries to use the stricter route.
The solution is to make the matching of a more
restrictive pattern , so that /group/tree does not match /group/:groupId using a regex that forces the groupId to be a
MongoDB ObjectID string.

- Support multiple roles
